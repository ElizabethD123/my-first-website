# My very first webpage

Welcome!

Link  to deployed project: https://elizabethd123.github.io/my-first-website/

Technology used: HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub and Cloud9!

The aim of this was to create my firstweb page. I followed instructions but decided
to choose my own font and colour.

I also decided to have the links open in a new window.

Thanks.
